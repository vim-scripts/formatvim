Main features:
    - Add 'colorcolumn' support
    - Add spelling support
    - Add allfolds support in diffformat mode
    - Add 'wrap' and related options support ('linebreak', 'listchars': 
      extends/precedes, 'showbreak', 'wrapmargin')

`:Format screenshot`:
    - Add support for |cpo-n| if support for a view just like in vim will be 
      added
    - Add support for visual mode highlighting
    - 'cursorcolumn' and cursor support

Testing:
    - Add new tests, disable some present ones
    - Test @<@{expr}@>@
    - Test diffformat better, it was known to have some bugs that I do not know 
      whether they continue to exist
    - Test how cursorcolumn, cursorline, cursor, colorcolumn, sign, diff, syntax 
      and matches highlighting work alltogether
    - Test IgnoreDiff option: with and without diffformat
    - Test 'highlight'

    - Test formats with and without persistent* conditions

    - Test tag ending at EOL (regression: it used to skip tagend)

    - Test non-full-file diffformat: check whether it may yield lists with 
      different number of items.

UI:
    - When using tags add support for progress bar to formattags function
    - Same for matches

Customization:
    - Make it support using line spec for line numbers, diff fillers (including 
      collapsed), sign and fold columns

Refactoring:
    - Split main formatting function
    - Move persistent* variables to opts

Optimizations:

Bugs:
    - Fix handling of `!!' and `!' tags in help files
    - Fix 'highlight' support: 'highlight' option may hold something other then 
      list of C:HiGroup pairs.
    - Fix sign columns highlighting near diff filler (see 
      signs.yaml%icons-noPATH)
