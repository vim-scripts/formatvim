There are some things that included out-of-the-box 2html.vim plugin does not support, so I ended in writing my own format.vim script:

     'list' and 'listchars' (tab, trail, eol, conceal, including the case when 'list' is on and 'lcs' does not contain tab);
     Foreground colors for lines with differencies (if I am not mistaking, implemented in latest 2html);
     Normal special character coloring;
     Background color for the whole line with differencies and folds, not just for text;
     Tags linked to their definition (slow, HTML only (unless you write specification by yourself), but partially on by default, also implemented by vimscript #2252 for 2html);
     Side-by-side diff (also present in latest 2html version);
     Full conceal support, including 'cole', 'lcs:conceal' and saving information about actual text present;
     Foldcolumn support (2html generates foldcolumn only if dynamic_folds is on, and this foldcolumn is different from what Vim actually displays);
     Signs support, including icons
     Non-copyable foldcolumns and numbers
     'Fillchars' option support (diff, fold and vert keys);
     My killer feature: exporting to any format you can write specification for. (for example, bbcode; bbcode specification for unixforum.org is included in the distribution).

You can also see lots of examples in the mercurial repository: all test/*.ok. They are also duplicated at formatvim.sourceforge.net/*.html, exact names are generated out of *.ok files using the following command:
    zmv -C '(*).ok' 'outs/${${${${${1//_/__}//\%/_}//$/_d}//!/_b}//>/_g}.html'
