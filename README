There are some things that included out-of-the-box 2html.vim plugin does not support, so I ended in writing my own format.vim script:

     'list' and 'listchars' (tab, trail, eol, conceal, including the case when 'list' is on and 'lcs' does not contain tab)
     Foreground colors for lines with differencies (if I am not mistaking, implemented in latest 2html)
     Normal special character coloring
     Background color for the whole line with differencies and folds, not just for text
     Tags linked to their definition (slow, HTML only (unless you write specification by yourself), but partially on by default, also implemented by vimscript #2252 for 2html)
     Side-by-side diff (also present in latest 2html version)
     Full conceal support, including 'cole', 'lcs:conceal' and saving information about actual text present
     Foldcolumn support (2html generates foldcolumn only if dynamic_folds is on, and this foldcolumn is different from what Vim actually displays)
     My killer feature: exporting to any format you can write specification for. (for example, bbcode; bbcode specification for unixforum.org is included in the distribution)
