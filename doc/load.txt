This plugin provides the ability to autoload other plugins on demand, create 
global functions and commands and share plugin's functionality.

Features:
    ∙ Autoloading plugins on |FuncUndefined| event.
    ∙ Autoloading plugins when their command is called.
    ∙ Autoloading plugins when their mapping is used.
    ∙ Autoloading plugins when their functionality is required.
    ∙ Displaying plugins' status.
    ∙ Unloading and reloading plugins.
    ∙ Searching for a function number through registered plugins.

This plugin requires chk plugin.

2. Functionality provided                               *load-functionality*

This plugin provides one command and one function. Both command and function 
names start with Load, but this prefix can be altered by _fprefix and _cprefix 
options in g:loadOptions dictionary (Note that it is a very bad idea).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1. Commands                                                *load-commands*
                                                              *load-actions*

:LoadCommand {action} ...                     *load-:Command* *:LoadCommand*
            The only command provided by this plugin. If variable 
            g:loadOptions exists and has key _cprefix, then prefix Load is 
            altered.
:LoadCommand unload {plugin}                            *load-action-unload*
            Unload plugin named {plugin} and all plugins that depend on it.
            Unloading is done in the following order:
            0. If plugin is not already loaded it is first loaded and only 
               then unloaded.
            1. Plugin is unregistered. See |load-func-unreg|.
            2. |load-reg-F|.main.destruct function is called. See |load-reg-F| 
               for details.
            3. |load-reg-g| and |load-reg-F| variables are unlocked.
            4. All keys in |load-reg-g| and |load-reg-F| are deleted.
            In order to be able to be unloaded correctly your plugin must 
            follow the following rules:
            1. Put all functions into s:F dictionary and use it as 
               |load-reg-F|. If some function cannot be put into dictionary 
               (for example, because you cannot use script variables in 
               mappings), then this function should be deleted in 
               s:F.main.destruct function.
            2. Put all script variables into s:g dictionary and use it as 
               |load-reg-g|. Use dictionary where keys are buffer numbers 
               instead of buffer variables. If you still require to modify 
               external variables, then they should be reset in 
               s:F.main.destruct function.
            3. Do other cleanup (like deleting completion function created by 
               comp.vim plugin) inside s:F.main.destruct.
            4. Last three lines of s:F.main.destruct must be >
                    unlet s:g
                    unlet s:F
                    return 1
:LoadCommand reload {plugin}                            *load-action-reload*
            Reload plugin named {plugin}. Just like |load-action-unload|, but 
            after unloading |load-reg-file|s are sourced. Note that reloading 
            some widely used plugins like vimargumentchec (chk) or even this 
            (load) plugin itself may render other plugins useless.
:LoadCommand show                                         *load-action-show*
            Show |load-reg-scriptid|, |load-reg-name|, |load-reg-file| and 
            status for all plugins. Possible statuses: registered and loaded. 
            See |load-reg| for details.
:LoadCommand findnr {nr}                                *load-action-findnr*
            Find a function with number {nr}. Function is searched through
            |load-reg-F| variables of plugins.
:LoadCommand nrof {fname}                                 *load-action-nrof*
            Display a number of function {fname}. {fname} must have the 
            following structure: /{plugname}/{pathToFunction}.
:LoadCommand autocmd {event} {plugin} {command}        *load-action-autocmd*
            Create an `autocommand', see |load-autocommands|. For 
            a description of arguments see |load-func-autocmd|. Note that you 
            need to escape all spaces in {command}.
:LoadCommand autocmd! {event}[ {plugin}[ {command}]]  *load-action-autocmd!*
            Delete an `autocommand', see |load-autocommands|. For 
            a description of arguments see |load-func-delautocmd|. Note that 
            you need to escape all spaces in {command}.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2. Functions                                              *load-functions*
                                   *load-func-LoadFuncdict* *LoadFuncdict()*
This plugin provides only one global function: LoadFuncdict (prefix Load may 
be altered, but this is a very bad idea). You can also use load#LoadFuncdict() 
which loads the plugin and then calls LoadFuncdictbb(). This function returns 
a dictionary with the following keys (each value is a function reference):

                                                  *load-func-registerplugin*
registerplugin({regdict})
            Register plugin. For the meaning of the argument see |load-reg|. 
            Returns a dictionary with following keys:
            Key        Value ~
            name       Name of the plugin. Now it is the filename without path 
                       and extension
            functions  Some useful functions:
                       eerror({srcname}, {etype}, {arg1}, ...)
                            Display the error message with pattern
                                {plugname}/{srcname}:{etypestr}({msgs})
                            Here {plugname} stands for plugin name (see the 
                            `name' key above), {srcname} is a string provided 
                            as the first argument, {etypestr} is a string 
                            obtained from |load-reg-g|.etype[{etype}] (or 
                            empty string if it does not exist) and {argN} are 
                            handled in following way:
                            1. If {arg1} (only {arg1}, not {argN}) is 
                               a non-zero number then throw error message 
                               after echoing it.
                            2. If {argN} is a list, its first value is 
                               a string and exists 
                               |load-reg-g|.emsg[{argN}[0]], then add 
                               printf(|load-reg-g|.emsg[{argN}[0]], {argN}[1], 
                               {argN}[2], ...) to {msgs}.
                            3. In other cases add {argN} to {msgs}.
                            String {msgs} is a list of strings separated by
                            ": ".
                        option({optname})
                            Try getting option named {optname} first from 
                            b:{optionPrefix}Options, then from 
                            g:{optionPrefix}Options and finally from 
                            |load-reg-g|.defaultOptions. Throw an exception on 
                            failure. If exists 
                            |load-reg-g|.c.options[{optname}], then use it to 
                            check obtained option by function 
                            |chk-func-checkargument|. Throw an exception if 
                            check failed. Note that all option names starting 
                            with underscore are reserved.

unregister({plugname})                                *load-func-unregister*
        Unregister plugin. For {plugname} argument see |load-reg-name|. 
        “Unregister” means:
        1. delete all global functions;
        2. delete all commands;
        3. remove plugin dictionary.

getfunctions({plugname})                            *load-func-getfunctions*
        Get the dictionary functions listed in |load-reg-dictfunctions| 
        argument provided when plugin {plugname} was registered. For 
        {plugname} argument see |load-reg-name|.

autocmd({event}, {plugin}, {command})                   *load-func-autocmd*
        Register an autocommand. For a description of {event} see 
        |load-autocommands|. {plugin} is any string that can be a plugin name. 
        {command} is either a string which will be executed (see |:execute|) 
        or a function reference which will be called with two arguments: 
        {event} and {plugin}.

delautocmd({event}[, {plugin}[, {command}]])         *load-func-delautocmd*
        Delete `autocommand(s)': if only {event} is given, then all 
        `autocommands' attached to this event are cleared. If {plugin} is 
        given, then it deletes all `autocommands' associated with the given 
        event and given plugin (if any). If both {plugin} and {command} 
        arguments are given, then it filters out all autocommands that match 
        all of {event}, {plugin} and {command}.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3. `Autocommands'                                      *load-autocommands*

This plugin provides a way to run custom hooks on the following events:

RegisterPluginPre                                *load-au-RegisterPluginPre*
        Before plugin registration. Note that there is no way to catch this 
        event for a load plugin as it must be loaded before you are able to 
        define any autocommand.
RegisterPluginPost                              *load-au-RegisterPluginPost*
        After plugin registration. Note that there is no way to catch this 
        event for a load plugin as it must be loaded before you are able to 
        define any autocommand.
LoadPluginPre                                        *load-au-LoadPluginPre*
        After plugin registration, before plugin is sourced second time.
        Some note's:
        1. There is no way to catch this event for a load plugin as it must be 
           loaded before you are able to define any autocommand.
        2. If plugin is sourced only once (if it defines |load-reg-oneload| 
           key) then this event occures just after 
           |load-au-RegisterPluginPre|.
LoadPluginPost                                      *load-au-LoadPluginPost*
        After plugin is sourced second time.
        Some note's:
        1. There is no way to catch this event for a load plugin as it must be 
           loaded before you are able to define any autocommand.
        2. If plugin is sourced only once (if it defines |load-reg-oneload| 
           key) then this event never occures.
UnloadPluginPre                                    *load-au-UnloadPluginPre*
        Just before unloading the plugin.
UnloadPluginPost                                  *load-au-UnloadPluginPost*
        Just after unloading the plugin.

3. Plugin registration                                            *load-reg*

Registration is done via calling |load-func-register| function with a single 
dictionary as an argument. The following keys are required: oprefix, funcdict, 
globdict, sid, scriptfile, apiversion. Possible keys:
                                                    *load-reg-dictfunctions*
dictfunctions :: [({dictname}, {internalname}, {check})]
        List of lists of three items:
        {dictname}     any string, which will be the function name in the
                       dictionary returned by |load-func-getfunctions|.
        {internalname} string, which consist of alphanumeric characters,
                       underscores and dots, where dot does neither start nor 
                       end the string. Dictionary function with name 
                       |load-reg-F|.{internalname} must exist. Value returned 
                       by this function will be returned by {dictname} 
                       dictionary function.
        {check}        Argument check for a function or an empty dictionary if
                       no check is required. See |chk-func-checkarguments| for 
                       more details.
fprefix :: String                                         *load-reg-fprefix*
        String which starts either with g: or with uppercase latin letter and 
        contains any number of latin letters, digits and underscores. It is 
        the default function prefix for plugin being registered. You must not 
        use this key unless `functions' key is present.
cprefix :: String                                         *load-reg-cprefix*
        String which starts with uppercase latin letter and contains any 
        number of latin letters, digits and underscores. It is the default 
        command prefix for plugin being registered. You must not use this key 
        unless `commands' key is present.
oprefix :: String                                         *load-reg-oprefix*
        String, which contains any number of latin letters, digits and 
        underscores. It is used to construct option dictionary name 
        (g:{oprefix}Options), which is used to get custom command (from 
        g:{oprefix}Options._cpferix) and function (from 
        g:{oprefix}Options._fprefix) prefixes, and also to get options by an 
        option function (see |load-func-registerplugin|).
                                                                *load-reg-F*
funcdict :: Dictionary                                   *load-reg-funcdict*
        Dictionary with plugin functions. The load plugin assumes that all 
        functions are declared as dictionary functions inside this 
        dictionary.
                                                                *load-reg-g*
globdict :: Dictionary                                   *load-reg-globdict*
        Dictionary with global script variables. The load plugin assumes that 
        this dictionary is the only s: variable declared in the plugin.
commands :: Dictionary                                   *load-reg-commands*
        Dictionary {{CmdTail}: {Arguments}}, where arguments is a dictionary 
        with the following keys:
        Key       Value ~
        func      string, which consist of alphanumeric characters,
                  underscores and dots, where dot does neither start nor end 
                  the string. Dictionary function with name 
                  |load-reg-F|.{internalname} must exist. This function is 
                  called when the command {cprefix}{CmdTail} is run. Arguments 
                  of the function (depending on other keys, some of them may 
                  not be present):
                  '<bang>', '<reg>', <LINE1>, <LINE2>, <count>, <f-args>.
        nargs     “+”, “?”, “*”, “0”, natural number or an empty string.
                  See |:command-nargs|. Adds <f-args> to the function 
                  arguments.
        range     “%”, non-negative number or an empty string.
                  See |:command-range|. Adds <LINE1> and <LINE2> to function 
                  arguments.
        count     Non-negative number or an empty string.
                  See |:command-count|. Adds <count> to function arguments.
        bang      Emty string. See |:command-bang|.
                  Adds '<bang>' to function arguments.
        bar       Emty string. See |:command-bar|.
        reg       Emty string. See |:command-register|.
                  Adds '<reg>' to function arguments.
        complete  Non-empty string. See |:command-complete| for possible
                  values. Note that for custom completion function it must be 
                  equal either to custom=s:{FunctionName} or 
                  customlist=s:{FunctionName}. In both cases 
                  |load-reg-F|.comp.{FunctionName} function must exist because 
                  it will be silently (see |:silent|) called instead of 
                  s:{FunctionName}.
        This key is used to construct plugin's commands. Note that existing 
        commands will not be redefined. Key `cprefix' must also be present.
                                                        *load-reg-functions*
functions :: [({functiontail}, {internalname}, {check})]
        List of lists of three items:
        {functiontail} string, which consist of any number of latin letters,
                       digits and underscores. It is used to construct plugin 
                       global function's name ({fprefix}{functiontail}).
        {internalname} string, which consist of alphanumeric characters, 
                       underscores and dots, where dot must not start or end 
                       the string or follow another dot. Dictionary function 
                       with name |load-reg-F|.{internalname} must exist. Value 
                       returned by this function will be returned by 
                       constructed function.
        {check}        Argument check for a function or an empty dictionary if
                       no check is required. See |chk-func-checkarguments| for 
                       more details.
        This key is used to construct plugin's global functions. Note that 
        existing functions will not be redefined. Key `fprefix' must also be 
        present.
mappings :: {{MapName}: {MapOptions}}                    *load-reg-mappings*
        Dictionary where keys are map names (names that start with underscore 
        are reserved, they also must not start with `+') and values are 
        dictionaries with the following keys:
        Key       Description ~
        function  String, which consist of alphanumeric characters, 
                  underscores and dots, where dot must not start or end the 
                  string or follow another dot. Required Dictionary function 
                  with name |load-reg-F|.{function} must exist. Value returned 
                  by this function is used as {rhs} of the mapping, see 
                  |:map-<expr>|. This function must take four arguments: type 
                  of mapping (one character, see below), mapping name, 
                  sequence of keys which invoked it (mapping string) and 
                  buffer number, if it was mapping local to buffer or -1 if it 
                  was not.
        default   String, defines a default {lhs} of the mapping. May be 
                  overriden by g:{oprefix}Options._maps.
        type      Char, defines a type of the mapping. Possible types and 
                  corresponding commands:
                  Type        Command ~
                  " " (space) noremap
                   !          noremap!
                  n, v, x, s, o, i, l, c
                              {Type}noremap
        silent    Bool. If true, then <silent> argument is added to the map 
                  command.
        leader    Bool. If true, then either |load-reg-leader| or 
                  |load-opt-_leader| is prepended to the default mapping.
leader :: String                                           *load-reg-leader*
        Defines the mapping leader.
sid :: String                                            *load-reg-scriptid*
        The script id obtained by s:SID function called in the plugin. See 
        |<SID>| for more details.
                                                             *load-reg-name*
scriptfile :: String                                   *load-reg-scriptfile*
        The script filename. It is used to autoload plugin and also to get 
        a plugin name using |fnamemodify|(a:scriptfile, ":t:r") (filename 
        without extension and path). Must end with `.vim'.
oneload :: Bool                                           *load-reg-oneload*
        Defines whether plugin needs to be autoloaded (defines whether plugin 
        file needs to be sourced twice before plugin is actually ready to 
        work).
apiversion :: String                                   *load-reg-apiversion*
        String, defines the api version. Must consist of a number (unsigned 
        integer) followed by a dot and another unsigned integer. Everything 
        after this is ignored.
requires :: [[{PlugName}, {APIVersion}]]                 *load-reg-requires*
        List of lists of two items. Defines requirements for the plugin. 
        Requirements are considered satisfied if {PlugName} was loaded, its 
        major api version number is equal to the one specified in {APIVersion} 
        and minor api version number greater then or equal to the one 
        specified in {APIVersion}. Minor api version number may be omitted. 
        {APIVersion} has syntax equal to |load-reg-apiversion|.

4. Options                                                   *load-options*

Plugin registered by |load-func-registerplugin| automatically gets some 
options:

_cprefix :: String                                      *load-opt-_cprefix*
_fprefix :: String                                      *load-opt-_fprefix*
        Global. This options override command and function prefixes provided 
        to |load-func-registerplugin|. They have the same restrictions as 
        |load-reg-cprefix| and |load-reg-fprefix|.
_maps :: {{MapName}: String}                               *load-opt-_maps*
        This option provides a way to override default values given in 
        |load-reg-mappings| either locally (local to buffer) or globally. If 
        {MapName} starts with `{-' and contains string `-}', then everything 
        between starting `{-' and first occurence of `-}' is stripped, 
        providing a way to map several strings to one {MapName}. If {MapName} 
        starts with `+' then `+' is stripped and plugin mapping leader is 
        prepended to the string (see |load-opt-_leader| for details). Note 
        that `{-...-}' is stripped before checking for `+'. Empty string 
        disables mapping.
_leader :: String                                        *load-opt-_leader*
        Overrides plugin mapping leader provided in |load-reg-leader|.
_disablemaps :: Bool                                *load-opt-_disablemaps*
        Global. If true then all plugin mappings are disabled. May be set to 
        1 in |load-reg-g|.defaultOptions in order to disable mappings by
        default.

This plugin also has its own options:

DisableLoadChecks :: Bool                      *load-opt-DisableLoadChecks*
        Disables checking of |load-func-registerplugin| argument, speeding up 
        loading of plugins that use it. On by default, should be turned off by 
        plugin developers.
