1. Intro                                                        *comp-intro*

This plugin makes creating custom completion functions much easier.

Features:
  ∙ Ability to get variants from list and from dictionary keys
  ∙ Ability to get variants from custom function
  ∙ Allows modifying the completion description

Plugin requires chk, stuf and load plugins.

==============================================================================
2. Functionality provided                               *comp-functionality*

This plugin provides only two functions: one that creates completion function 
and one that removes it. Both functions are available from dictionary returned 
by |load-func-getfunctions| function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1. Functions                                              *comp-functions*

All following functions are accessed via dictionary returned by 
|load-func-getfunctions| function.

ccomp({funcname}, {model})                                 *comp-func-ccomp*
        Create a new completion function. {funcname} must be unique, but its 
        only purpose is to provide a way to delete last reference to {model} 
        when plugin is un- or reloaded. See |comp-models| for description of 
        {model} argument.
delcomp({funcname})                                      *comp-func-delcomp*
        Delete reference to {model} that was created by |comp-func-ccomp| 
        function.

==============================================================================
3. Models                                                      *comp-models*

Completion model is a dictionary that contains required `model' key and some 
additional keys depending on the value of the `model' key. Possible models 
(`model' key values):

actions                                                 *comp-model-actions*
        Optional keys: actions :: { {action}: {model} }
        Defines a completion for command that looks like this: >
            Command action1 some_argument
            Command action2 some_argument some_other argument
            Command action3
            ...
<
        Each value defines a model for the corresponding key which represents 
        the action name.
simple                                                   *comp-model-simple*
        Optional keys: arguments :: [{ListDescription}]
        Defines a completion for command that takes a list of arguments, for 
        each possible arguments a {ListDescription} must be defined. See 
        |comp-listdescription| for details.
words                                                     *comp-model-words*
        Required keys: words :: {ListDescription}
        Defines a completion for command that takes a list of arguments that 
        are not connected with each other, for every argument 
        a {ListDescription} from words key is used. See |comp-listdescription| 
        for details.
pref                                                       *comp-model-pref*
        Optional keys: arguments :: [{ListDescription}]
                       prefix :: { {prefix}: {ListDescription} }
        Defines a completion for command that takes a list of arguments, 
        followed by prefixed arguments. Example: >
            Command print columns 3
            Command print buffer %
            " The following commands are assumed to be equal
            Command print buffer % columns 3
            Command print columns 3 buffer %
<
        Key `argument' is handled just like in |comp-model-simple|. Key 
        `prefix' describes prefixes and corresponding arguments.
                          *comp-model-inputactions* *comp-model-inputsimple*
                              *comp-model-inputwords* *comp-model-inputpref*
input{model}                                              *comp-model-input*
        Like {model}, but for use in |input()| completion.
                        *comp-model-insertactions* *comp-model-insertsimple*
                            *comp-model-insertwords* *comp-model-insertpref*
insert{model}                                            *comp-model-insert*
        Like {model}, but for use in insert mode completion (see 
        |complete()|). For insert-mode models additional key is allowed: 
        `start': it defines where completed word starts and is either a string 
        starting with `_', regular expression or function reference.

        If `start' key is a function reference, it must take current line 
        contents (string, not including part starting from the cursor 
        position) and return column number which will be passed as a first 
        argument to |complete()| function. If this function will return 
        something other then positive integer, then completion will be aborted 
        and nothing will be completed.

        If `start' key is a regular expression (which must not start with `_', 
        use |/\%(| if you need to have `_' at the start of regular 
        expression), then |match()| with current line contents (not including 
        part starting from the cursor position, so |/$| will match before 
        cursor position) as a first argument and this regex as a second must 
        give starting column (first argument to |complete()|). If |match()| 
        fails, then completion will be aborted and nothing will be completed. 

        Value of `start' key may be also one of the following strings:
        String  Description ~
        _cword  Complete |word| before the cursor. Considers words that 
                contains only blank characters to be empty. It is the default 
                behavior if `start' key was not specified.
        _cWORD  Complete |WORD| before the cursor. Considers WORDs that 
                contains only blank characters to be empty.
        _cfile  Complete filename before the cursor.

There are also two additional keys that are valid for any model: argsplitregex 
and escape. Key `argsplitregex' must contain a regular expression which will 
be passed to |split()| when plugin will try to split current line into an 
arguments list. Default value: '\(\\\@<!\(\\.\)*\\\)\@<! ' (splits on 
non-escaped spaces). Note that for insert-mode completion `start' has an 
advantage over `argsplitregex', so the last word is determined by it and won't 
be split. Key `escape' determines, whether completion list will be escaped by 
|fnameescape()| function (2), using |escape()| with `\\|\" \n' as a second 
argument (1) or not escaped at all (0). Default value: 1 for normal 
(command-line) models, 0 for input and insert models.

==============================================================================
4. Argument descriptions                              *comp-listdescription*

Argument description is a list that contains two item: first is the type of 
description and second is description argument:

Type    Argument and description ~
list    List                                               *comp-descr-list*
        Take possible variants from the specified list.
keyof   Dictionary                                        *comp-descr-keyof*
        Take possible variants from the list of keys of the specified 
        dictionary.
                                                          *comp-descr-=file*
file    String                                             *comp-descr-file*
        Take possible variants from the list of files created by zsh-like 
        completion function. {Argument} is a string with the following form: >
            ([drwW])*(.{ext})*(/{regex})*
<       This string consist of the following atoms:
        1. One or more characters that describe type of the file: `d' stands 
           for `directory', `r' for `readable file' (but not readable 
           directory), `w' for `writeable file', `W' for `writeable file or 
           directory'. Note that directories will always be completed, even if 
           both `d' and `W' are absent. Use `d' if you want to complete only 
           directories.
        2. .{ext} describes extension of the files. It may appear more then 
           once. Note that {ext} may contain escaped dot, so if you need to 
           complete gzipped tar archives, you can use `.tar\.gz.tgz'. 
           Extensions are matched case insensitively.
        3. /{regex} describes regular expression which must be matched by file 
           name. By default, regex is matched case insensitively, but you may 
           use |/\C|.
        Note: `W.tar.7z/\.\(zip\|rar\)$' means the following: complete 
              writeable files (`W') that end with `\.tar' (`.tar'), `.7z' 
              (.7z), `.zip' or `.rar' (`/\.\(zip\|rar\)$')
              ([drwW] AND (.{ext1} OR .{ext2} OR ...
                           OR /{regex1} OR /{regex2} OR ...)).
        Note: You may use `=file' instead of `file' as a type of argument 
              description. Equality sign enables strict matching: if it is not 
              enabled, then absense of matches will disable filter, otherwise 
              it will complete nothing.
                                                         *comp-descr-=file!*
file!   {Check}                                           *comp-descr-file!*
        Like file, but resulting file list is filtered through 
        |chk-func-checkargument|. If there are no matches, {Argument} is 
        ignored. For example, argument description ["file", ".txt"] and 
        ["file!", ["regex", '\.txt$']] are just the same, but first version is 
        faster.
        Note: You may use `=file!' instead of `file!' as a type of argument 
              description. Equality sign enables strict matching: if it is not 
              enabled, then absense of matches will disable filter, otherwise 
              it will complete nothing.
func    Function reference                                 *comp-descr-func*
        Take possible variants from the returned value of a function provided 
        as {Argument} called with an only argument: {ArgLead}. This function 
        must return a list of Strings, all values that are not Strings are 
        ignored. Note that comp.vim will filter resulting list for you, so you 
        do not need to care about it.
func!   Function reference                                *comp-descr-func!*
        Like |comp-descr-func|, but without any filtering.
merge   [{ListDescription}]                               *comp-descr-merge*
        Merge lists of possible values obtained after processing all 
        {ListDescription}s.
first   [{ListDescription}]                               *comp-descr-first*
        Process {ListDescription}s given in {Argument}, return first non-empty 
        list of possible values or empty list if all descriptions gave an 
        empty list.

==============================================================================
5. Options                                                    *comp-options*

TrailingSeparator :: Bool                       *comp-opt-TrailingSeparator*
    If this option is present and is true (default), then |comp-descr-file| 
    and |comp-descr-file!| add path separator at the end of each directory 
    name.
